To what extent can we identify student struggles from AST based code representations?
How can we identify student learning from patterns in the change of ASTs  from student code? -- e.g. increase in speed  towards getting to correct ASTs?

## Abstract Syntax Trees

[python-ast-explorer](https://python-ast-explorer.com/) site allows you to put in some python code and see the abstract syntax tree as output

[Comparing Python Programs Using Abstract Syntax Trees](https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/bitstream/handle/1992/44754/u830947.pdf) outlines how to compare abstract syntax trees

## Current

- Chart of percent of recoveries with an attempted run before syntax error resolution
  - Each recovery start has a column for run_before_recovery
    - Switch to fail column indicates start
- Chart of percent of known recoveries with an attempted run before syntax error resolution
  - Each known recovery start has a column for run_before_recovery


How many events does it take to create a specific ast sub-structure?


Character count next to ast node count
